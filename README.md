# MSP430F5529 Starter Code

Starter code for WPI's ECE2049 - Embedded Computing in Engineering Design.

Originally designed by Professor Susan Jarvis. 

Extensively edited by me near the start of the Covid 19 pandemic to support new peripheral devices required either due to certain discontinuations (eg. TI Sharp 96 display) or inability to send students WPI's proprietary MSP430F5529 expansion boards.

To run, please download and install the latest version of Code Composer Studio, connect your MSP430F5529, then build and launch the program.
